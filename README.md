# text-based-python-game

This is a game I have started to work on (April 2024) to help me better grasp Python language. I have a passion of gaming and a strong interest in learning game development. I grew up reading "Choose your own adventure" books and as an adult, I have loved playing text-based games. This is a (passion) project I am very excited to build on over time and turn into a full browser game. 

I am building this right now with Python, HTML, and CSS right now.
